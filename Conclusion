Conclusions:
Best Model:
The Random Forest Classifier with the optimal ccp_alpha was the best-performing model in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. Its ensemble approach and feature handling were well-suited for the problem.

Feature Importance:
Features like practice_exams_passed, minutes_watched, and days_on_platform emerged as key predictors of user purchases.

Business Implications:
Users who spend more time on the platform and engage more with practice exams are more likely to purchase.
Strategies focusing on increasing platform engagement (e.g., more interactive content, incentivized practice exams) could drive conversions.

Future Enhancements:
Further exploration of user-specific engagement patterns might help segment users for targeted marketing campaigns.
Incorporating additional features (e.g., demographic data, session duration) might improve model performance further.
